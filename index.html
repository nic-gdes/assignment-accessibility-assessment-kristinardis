      <h1>The trouble with Bears</h1> <!-- you should really only use a single h1 on a page, with h2, h3, etc nested within it -->
      <p> by Evan Wild</p>

      <p> Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from the renowned
        documentary, "The Jungle Book".</p>

      <p> So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this
        article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>

      <h2>Types of bears</h2> <!-- missed a "/" here -->

          <p> Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
            then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>

          <p> Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home
            in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour however, as
            you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.</p>

          <table>
            <caption>
              Some Facts about bears
            </caption> <!-- great job adding a caption! You want it as an immediate child of the <table> element though, not within any other children -->
              <thead>

                </tr>
              </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">Wild</th> <!-- since these headings are describing the row they're on, we want to use the scope="row" attribute instead of col. -->
                <td>Brown or black</td>
                <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
                <td>Woods and forests</td>
                <td>25 to 28 years</td>
                <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>

            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>Habitats and Eating habits</h2>

              <p> Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In
                general they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down
                their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents,
                or cottages.</p>

              <img src="media/wild-bear.jpg" alt="This is a picture of a wild bear"> <!-- You could add a bit more context here. What does this type of bear actually look like? What if the user has never seen a wild or urban bear? -->

              <p> Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other
                urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge
                from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has
                proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials
                like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.</p>

              <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="A picture of an urban bear"> <!-- You could add a bit more context here. What does this type of bear actually look like? What if the user has never seen a wild or urban bear? -->

              <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to
                their own apartment.</p>

              <h2>Mating rituals</h2>

              <p> Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the
                rest of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive —
                for example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a
                Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban bear.</p>

              <p> The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals, along
                with samples and quotes from experts.</p>

                <h2>About the author</h2>

                    <p> Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "in to" wildlife since
                      childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a dinner kebab.</p>

                    <p> He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound
                      cool.</p>

                  <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                    little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all
                    in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
